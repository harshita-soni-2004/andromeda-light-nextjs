Launching your product in phases rather than waiting for it to be fully completed is a smarter and more effective approach. A phased launch allows you to bring a minimum viable product (MVP) to market quickly, gather real user feedback, and make necessary improvements early on. 


Instead of investing all your time and resources into building a fully-featured product that may or may not meet user needs, you can test your core idea, validate assumptions, and iterate based on actual user behavior.

 This reduces the risk of failure, helps identify and fix issues faster, and ensures that you are building features that truly add value. Moreover, it allows you to enter the market sooner, gain a competitive advantage, and start building brand awareness while continuing development.
 
  By following this iterative approach, you can manage resources effectively, pivot if required, and create a product that evolves with user expectations and market demands.
